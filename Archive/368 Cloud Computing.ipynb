    "### The Cloud\n",
    "- SaaS\n",
    "    - vendor manages software and data on customer's behalf\n",
    "    - customer uses thing client or mobile apps\n",
    "    - price by usage or subscription\n",
    "    - like a utility company\n",
    "- SaaS administration is hard\n",
    "    - lots of moving parts\n",
    "    - host & secure physical servers\n",
    "    - connect to internet\n",
    "    - bandwitdth management\n",
    "    - lots more\n",
    "- You also have to make and manage the software!\n",
    "    - the cloud handles \"undifferentiated heavy lifting\"\n",
    "- The Cloud Benefits\n",
    "    - provides data and computing resources\n",
    "    - typically cheaper than running your own local servers\n",
    "    - scales up & down\n",
    "- Disadvantages\n",
    "    - DHH \"Why we are leaving the cloud\"\n",
    "    - can become costly\n",
    "    - good for startups and large companies with irregular loads (flash sales upping bandwidth rapidly, etc)\n",
    "- Managed hosting services\n",
    "    - you buy hardware\n",
    "    - provider does setup, hardware management, etc\n",
    "    - like boarding a dog\n",

    "### Cloud/Web Architecture Patterns\n",
    "- simplified view: Phone/browser/CLI <---> HTML <---> product\n",
    "- 3 tier architecture\n",
    "    - presentation tier\n",

    "        \n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "- Monolith method\n",
    "    - everything is in one giant server\n",
    "    - all the code in one place\n",
    "    - ADVs\n",
    "        - simple to develop, test, deploy, and scale\n",
    "        - good for small companies/startups\n",
    "        - even Shopify has a few monoliths\n",
    "            - e.g. core public API\n",
    "        - scaling\n",
    "            - vertical\n",
    "                - increase size of instance (RAM, CPU, etc)\n",
    "            - horizontal\n",
    "                - make more instances\n",
    "        - Load Balancer\n",
    "            - distributes traffic to the servers to manage bandwidth & availability\n",
    "        - Elastic computing / autoscaling\n",
    "            - can also decrease computing resources used when you have low traffic\n",
    "            - right-sizing resources\n",
    "            - avoid idle resources & therefore costs/waste\n",
    "    - DAs\n",
    "        - intimidating\n",
    "        - large files, long compile and start time\n",
    "        - testing is slow\n",
    "        - difficult load scaling\n",
    "        - difficult to scale development organization\n",
    "            - you might fix something that breaks someone else's thing\n",
    "        - technology lock in\n",
    "            - you're kindof stuck with whatever language/architecture/system you've written the whole thing in so far\n",
    "    - you can overcome these with lots of time, care, and investment"
