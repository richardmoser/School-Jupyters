    "#### Transing and Transpassing Across Sex-Gender Walls in Iran\n",
    "- gender affirming surgeries and hormonal treatments have been available since at least the 1970s\n",
    "- only recently (as of 2008) has there begun to be significant media interest in this topic\n",
    "- in addition to increased publicity, there has also been an increase in the number of surgeries and treatments being performed\n",
    "- homosexuality is illegal in Iran and SRS is legally, medically, and sometimes religiously sanctioned as a \"cure for a diseased abnormality\"\n",
    "    - the author argues that while this can create pressure for individuals to undergo SRS, it more importantly creates a space for individuals to be able to live their lives as they wish\n",
    "        - i.e. it gives them a position and identity within the social order which is seen as more legitimate\n",
    "- classical Islamic discourse contains a flexibly gender binary which accounts for hermaphrodites\n",
    "    - hence there is at least some understanding that gender may not always be strictly categorized along binary lines\n",
    "    - at the time of this piece's writing, transexuality is considered an extension of this understanding and is allowed on the basis that it is not explicitly forbidden in the Qur'an\n",
    "    - SRS is not required for a diagnosed transsexual unless they have religious concerns about sinning in their current body\n",
    "- increased knowledge and coverage has not necessarily led to increased acceptance but has led to increased visibility and understanding\n",
    "    - tabloids may still sensationalize the topic but they won't cover homosexuality at all\n",
    "- MtF individuals are often less accepted and are more likely to be thrown out of their homes than FtM individuals\n",
    "    - this is largely driven by the shame associated with homosexuality and anal sex (even though SRS would open them to other possibilities)\n",
    "        - many trans individuals state that they had never received penetrative intercourse before their surgeries and marriage\n",
    "- transsexual people often have to distance themselves from homosexuality in order to be accepted\n",
    "- the transition process involves a \"filter\" aimed to separate \"true transexuals\" from \"opportunist homosexuals\" who are trying to avoid persecution\n",
    "    - Islamic spiritual therapists in particular can be hostile and traumatizing\n",
    "- the author argues that by creating a semi legitimate space for transsexuality and a means to transition to it, the Islamic Republic has actually created a space for homosexuality to exist\n",
    "    - i.e. by creating gates between the two sides of the binary wall, it is possible to pass between them **and also to exist in the middle**\n",
    "    - legal and religious officials do not like when a certified transexual does not pursue hormones and SRS but they cannot legally force them to do so\n",
    "        - someone may occupy the middle space for as long as they wish before deciding to transition (or not)\n",
    "- some progress has been made to form alliance between the trans and homosexual communities\n"

    "    - How is transsexuality constructed in Iran?\n",
    "        - transness is seen as an extension of the hermaphroditic \"ambiguety\" case in the Qur'an and religio-socio-legal framework\n",
    "    - Why do transsexuals distinguish themselves from Homosexuals?\n",
    "        - homosexuality is still not accepted in Iran and is illegal but transexuality is more frequently accepted and can sometimes be seen as a \"cure\" for homosexuality which creates a \"legitimate\" identity within the social order.\n",
    "        - hence some people will seek to be categorized as transexual regardless of whether or not they want to pursue homrones, SRS, etc.\n",
    "    - Compare and contrast transition in Iran and the US\n",
    "        - In the US, popular (i.e. media, not super deep in the theory or community) discourse generally centers around trying to pass and fit into the binary. Surgical and hormonal treatments are more or less assumed to be the end goal of transition.\n",
    "        - In Iran it sounds like there is more awareness of the middle space and acceptance begins when someone identifies as trans, not when they have completed surgeries or treatments.\n",
    "    - How do the 4 major social systems shape transexuality in Iran?\n",
    "        - Religion: Classical teachings have been, at least in some ways, used to create legitimate space for transsexuality and gender ambiguity\n",
    "        - Legal: SRS is legally allowed and in many ways encouraged\n",
    "        - Science: SRS is seen as a medical treatment for what is considered to be a diseased abnormality\n",
    "        - Media: Increased visibility and understanding but also sensationalism and tabloidization\n"

    "#### The History of Sexuality\n",
    "##### The Incitement To Discourse\n",
    "- some would argue that after the 17th century, the \"repressive hypothesis\" of \"bourgeois restriction\" took hold\n",
    "    - i.e. the idea that sexuality was repressed and hidden away\n",
    "- Foucault argues that this is not the case and that sexuality was actually more openly discussed and debated\n",
    "    - the way in which it was discussed was what changed\n",
    "    - e.g. catholic confessional practices allowed the priest to ask explicit and specific questions about sexual practices as well as fantasies, daydreams, and other \"impure thoughts\"\n",
    "- sex became the realm of science and medicine\n",
    "    - through this clinicalization it was able to be discussed in a more open and public way\n",
    "    - e.g. Jouy, a mentally handicapped farmhand whose relations with an underage girl lead to public discussions around his arrest, his trial, medical and mental examinations and reports thereof, etc.\n",
    "        - i.e. the shift in thinking around sex as a more clinical and scientific matter allowed situations like Jouy's to be discussed publicly and openly\n",
    "##### The Perverse Implantation\n",
    "- Foucault argues that this new clinical view of sex invented, not codified, the idea of sexual perversion\n",
    "    - prior to the 18th century, sex was governed by\n",
    "        - *canonical* Christian religious teachings\n",
    "            - the moral code of the church as presented in the Bible\n",
    "        - Christian pastoral morality\n",
    "            - the moral code of the church as presented by the priest\n",
    "        - civil law\n",
    "            - the laws of the land\n",
    "    - as discussed a few weeks ago, Foucault argues that these codes did not make significant distinctions between different types of sexual acts which occured out of marriage\n",
    "        - e.g. sodomy, adultery, etc. were all seen as equally sinful\n",
    "        - they were also only seen as acts, not identities\n",
    "        - married couples were also subject to intrusion and scrutiny\n",
    "    - by the 18th and 19th centuries, much had changed\n",
    "        - now married couples were being given more privacy\n",
    "        - attention was turned to \"unnatural\" expressions of sexuality\n",
    "            - here we see the beginning of the idea of sexual perversion\n",
    "                - categorization, classification, and the creation of a taxonomy of sexual acts\n",
    "                - the formation of identities surrounding sexual acts\n",
    "    - \"operations\" of power\n",
    "        - 1.\n",
    "        - 2. medical discourse linked perversity to the root of a person's personality, creating identities from acts\n",
    "        - 3. study of perversion became its own perversion\n",
    "            - i.e. it allowed people to conduct experiments and studies into people's sexualities\n",
    "            - Foucault discusses pleasure as an important part of the power dynamic in places such as medicine, psychiatry, school discipline, and parental control\n",
    "                - pleasure is taken in the exercise of power\n",
    "                    - this takes access to pleasure from the disempowered (categorical pervert, child, etc) and gives it to the empowered (doctor, psychiatrist, parent, etc)\n",
    "                - my interpretation/analogy:\n",
    "                    - in the same way that popular discourse around Juoy allowed normal people to talk about sex openly, clinical \"studies\" of \"perversion\" allowed creepy doctors to ask creepy questions and conduct creepy experiments\n",
    "                        - in a less arch villain sense, this played out in doctors' offices, schools, and homes among normal people\n",
    "        - 4. surveillance moved into the home with new social codes being created\n",
    "            - e.g. around breastfeeding and masturbation\n",
    "            - the family was now living with this newly created specter of perversion\n",
    "    - these operations justified increased surveillance and scrutiny of sexual acts and granted the state and the church more power over the individual\n",
    "    - The \"implantation of perversions\" is a tool of political power through the regulation of sex\n",
    "        - the creation of \"perversion\" is an effect of and a tool of power\n",
    "        - the more institutions claim authority through fearmongering around perversion, the more categories of perversion are created and the more places there are to be surveilled\n",

    "- religion as law\n",
    "    - at this time, religious teachings and law were more or less synonymous\n",

    "        - summarized: children are now not supposed to experience sexual feelings and they shouldn't know anything about sex until taught it\n",

    "                - e.g. the US public education approach (at least what I had) talks about puberty (but not sex) at one age, then stairsteps up over time\n",

    "#### Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality (Gayle S. Rubin, 1984)\n",
    "- \"Disputes over sexual behaviour often become the vehicles for displacing social anxieties, and discharging their attendant emotional intensity\"\n",
    "- we are still living with the legacy of the 18th and 19th centuries and the \"repressive hypothesis\"\n",
    "    - while we don't tie children to beds or perform genital mutilation on young girls anymore, we still see a lot of the same attitudes and shames persisting\n",
    "    - anti-obscenity laws were put in place to police sexuality and sexual acts\n",
    "    - a \"white slave\" scare in the US and Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s\n",
    "        - this was used to pass anti-prostitution laws which were largely racist and classist\n",
    "    - in the 1950s, fear mongering shifted to homosexuality\n",
    "        - \"sex offender\" was used as a term for both rapists and homosexuals in its bureaucratic, medical, and common usage\n",
    "    - crackdowns, raids, and discrimination were common against queer people, prostitutes, and other \"erotic deviants\"\n",
    "- the article (from the 1980s) notes a significant increase in police persecution and aggression against queer people since 1977\n",
    "    - this was both under existing laws and new laws\n",
    "- in all this time, the war cry has generally been that it is about \"protecting children\"\n",
    "#### A somewhat gross section (but important to note)\n",
    "- the article also argues against a series of laws aimed at defining and preventing child pornography\n",
    "    - note: it is hard, for me at least, to read this without a modern lens and to sympathize with the author\n",
    "    - the article argues that the laws are not about protecting children but rather about controlling sexuality\n",
    "    - they cite art photographer Jacqueline Livingston who exhibited a series of male nudes including her seven year old son masturbating\n",
    "        - apparently this is an argument against the laws?\n",
    "    - it also seems to seek to validate the sexualization of and attraction to children\n",
    "        - e.g. \"boy-lovers are so stigmatized that it is difficult to find defenders for their civil liberties\"\n",
    "            - Nope. Don't love that.\n",
    "    - note: I am interjecting my own bias here and have likely misread, misunderstood, and/or misrepresented the content to some degree or other\n",
    "#### back to not as gross stuff\n",
    "- right wing fundamentalists have used fear around sex and sexuality to move from the fringes to the center stage since around 1977\n",
    "- a radical theory of sex\n",
    "    - several things hold us back\n",
    "        - sexual essentialism: the idea that sex is a natural force outside of social life\n",
    "            - within this view, sexuality has no history or social determination\n",
    "        - sexual negativity: the view that sex is bad and dangerous\n",
    "        - fallacy of misplaced scale: overreaction to sex\n",
    "                - e.g. punishing sex acts as if they were on the scale of theft or violence\n",
    "        - the heirarchical system of sexual value: the idea that some sexual acts are good and some are bad, abnormal, or immoral along some sliding scale\n",
    "        - the domino theory of sexual peril: the idea that if we allow one sexual act, it will lead to the acceptance of all sexual acts and the world will end\n",
    "        - lacking concept of benign sexual variation: a failure to recognize that sexual variation is normal and natural\n",
    "            - coupled with the belief that your sex is normal and everyone else either agrees or is a pervert\n",
    "- sexual transformations\n",
    "    - historical sex panics have formed our hierarchy of sex\n",
    "    - here she discusses the \"speciation\" or categorization and taxonimization Foucault discussed\n",
    "- sexual stratification\n",
    "    - the law has been used to create and enforce a hierarchy of sexual acts using the taxonomies created by the medical and scientific communities as a justification\n",
    "    - obscenity laws turn sex into a taboo that you can't talk about\n",
    "        - really, this is anticapitalist as it prevents commerce around sex and sexuality\n",
    "    - even when laws are not enforced, they are often effective at policing society\n",
    "        - sexual activity is generally perceived as constituting membership in a larger group\n",
    "            - e.g. MSM generally see themselves as part of the gay *identity* and *community*\n",
