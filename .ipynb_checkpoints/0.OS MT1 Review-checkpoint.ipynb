    "1. Explain the User’s and System’s view of the operating system.\n",
    "2. Explain the operating system goals.\n",
    "3. What is a multiprogramming OS? How does it differ from a batch OS? How does it differ from a time-sharing OS?\n",
    "    - A/2: \n",
    "        - a multiprogramming system will keep running a program until it is blocked by I/O or another event\n",
    "        - a batch system will run a program until it is finished\n",
    "        - a time-sharing system will run a program for a certain amount of time and then switch to another program\n",
    "            - best for user interactive systems\n",
    "        - in an infinite loop situation:\n",

    "7. What factors restrict the number of architected registers?\n",
    "8. What factors restrict the size of the cache? Why have multiple levels of caches?\n",
    "    - A/2: two main reasons\n",
    "        1. speed of access (larger cache is slower)\n",
    "        2. location/chip real estate (closer to CPU is faster but takes up space on the chip)\n",
    "            - this is why L1 is small and close to CPU, L2 is larger and further away, L3 is even larger and further away\n",
    "9. Explain if true or false:\n",
    "(a) The architecture registers are managed by the hardware.\n",

    "        - system calls are the interface between the OS and the user and require a context switch.\n",
