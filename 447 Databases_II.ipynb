    "        - attributes that don't belong together\n",
    "        - attributes with lots of NULL values\n",
    "    - general guidelines\n",
    "        - each tuple should represent a single entity or relationship instance\n",
    "            - the schema should be easilly explained relation by relation\n",
    "            - attributes should be easy to interpret\n",
    "            - foreign keys should be used to refer to other entities\n",
    "                - entity and relationship attributes should be kept separate as much as possible\n",
    "        - design a schema that avoids anomalies from insert/delete/updates\n",
    "            - consider `EMP_PROJ(Emp#, Proj#, Hours)`\n",
    "                - you cannot insert a project without an employee assigned to it\n",
    "                - deleting the project will delete the employees associated with it\n",
    "                - updating the project will require updating all employees associated with it\n",
    "                    - probably not efficiently\n",
    "        - relations should be designed to minimize NULL values in their tuples\n",
    "            - attributes that are frequently NULL may be better off in a separate relation\n",
    "        - relations should be designed to satisfy lossless join\n",
    "            - no spurious tuples should be generated when joining relations\n",

    "                    - **exam question^**\n",
    "                - if you join two relations, you should be able to get back the original relation\n",

    "        - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF\n",
    "            - 3NF is the most commonly used in industry\n",
    "            - BCNF is stronger and more restrictive\n",
    "                - it is easier to define than 3NF\n",
    "            - a well designed ER model will automatically yield relational tables in BCNF or even 4NF\n",
    "    - how?\n",
    "        - refining the schema\n",
    "        - decomposing relations with undesirable properties into smaller relations\n",

    "    - determining the normal form:\n",
    "        - the form is determined by the **primary keys** and **functional dependencies**\n",
    "            - Functional dependencies are the relationships between attributes in a relation\n",
    "        - i.e. you must understand how one piece of data relates to another within the entity\n",
    "        - the key helps determine if there are partial or transitive dependencies\n",
    "            - partial dependency: a functional dependency where a non-prime attribute is functionally dependent on part of a candidate key\n",
    "                - i.e. if the primary key is a composite key, then a non-prime attribute is dependent on only part of the composite key\n",
    "                - this is bad because it means that the relation is not in 2NF\n",
    "            - transitive dependency: a functional dependency where a non-prime attribute is functionally dependent on another non-prime attribute\n",
    "                - i.e. if the primary key is a composite key, then a non-prime attribute is dependent on another non-prime attribute\n",
    "                - this is bad because it means that the relation is not in 3NF\n",
    "        - the functional dependencies help identify potential redundancies and other areas of concern\n",
    "            - i.e. if the same data is stored in multiple places, then it is redundant\n",

    "                    - a zip code is a unique identifier for a city\n",
    "                    - the city is functionally dependent on the zip code\n",
    "                    - knowing the zip code allows you to determine the city\n",

    "    - constraints derived from the meaning and interrelationships of data attributes\n",
    "    - a set of attributes X functionally determines a set of attributes Y if each value of X is associated with exactly one value of Y\n",
    "        - i.e. if you know the value of X, you can determine the value of Y\n",
    "    - X -> Y holds if for all tuples with the same X have the same Y\n",
    "    - an FD is like a partial key\n",
    "        - it uniquely determines some but not all attributes\n",
    "    - a key is a special case of an FD\n",
    "        - a key uniquely determines all attributes in the relation\n",
    "    - these are derived from real-world constraints\n",
    "        - e.g. a student ID uniquely identifies a student\n",
