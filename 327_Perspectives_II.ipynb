    "    - it is fine if more than one do, but at least one must\n",

    "#### Instructions\n",
    "This assignment is designed to make you look at the world that surrounds you from a slightly different perspective: one that is particularly focused upon the ways that privilege and oppression are communicated to us all the time. The course materials should give you a clear idea of the many ways in which privilege and oppression operate in our own individual lives, our local communities, our country, and the world at large. Now is your chance to go out in the world and really find examples of the ways in which these socially constructed concepts shape our lived environment and interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project asks you to upload 4 pictures (of your own taking or found on the internet with permission to use it) that capture privilege or oppression in your world. One of these 4 pictures should relate to your own positionality (privileges or oppressions). Provide a source for all photos. Add your photos to a Word document. For each photo, write 200-250 words that briefly describe EACH image AND explain how the photo reflects a privilege or oppression in the world around us. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### \\*Additional Assessment for Core 34*\n",
    "This assignment will also be submitted anonymously to KU's repository of student work for assessment of the general education curriculum. It will be reviewed using the KU Core 34 rubric for the following US Culture learning outcomes: \n",
    "    - Identify own cultural rules and biases \n",
    "    - Reflect on how own attitudes and beliefs are different from those of other cultures and communities\n",
    "    - Identify and explain multiple perspectives \n",
    "    - Explain or connect multiple cultures historically or in contemporary contexts acknowledging power structures and demonstrating respectful interaction with cultures \n",
    "\n",
    "You will not be graded on whether you meet these outcomes for this class, and you do not need to do anything special to meet these particular outcomes. This information is just available to you so that you know other ways your work may be reviewed by the university. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing: 40%\n",
    "- Writing should be clear, concise, and constructive. Provide a short, direct description of what the picture captures and where you got it (when and where you took it or the date and website from which it came). Then dive into meaningful analysis that links to course concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis: 50%\n",
    "- This is where you explain why this picture meets the criteria for this assignment. Using clear and argument driven language, explain how each image captures privilege or oppression. This should show your understanding of privilege or oppression and demonstrate your ability to identify it in the world around you. Show me what you know! Analysis of intersectional oppressions welcome and encouraged!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Citations: 10%\n",
    "- Provide a source for your photograph in the following formats:\n",
    "Title of image, taken by (NAME OF PERSON WHO TOOK IT), date taken **OR** Website link, date accessed.\n",
    "    - doesn't need to be MLA/APA/other format, just needs to have the information above\n",

    "Description: A crumbling sidewalk leading to a subway stairwell in a lower-income neighborhood in New York City illustrates both the existence of curb cutouts for wheelchairs and the disrepair of low-income neighborhoods that make them useless to people in wheelchairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis: This image captures the intersection of oppressions faced by people experiencing poverty and whose bodies require a wheelchair. Clearly the city landscape requires mobility, evidenced by the sidewalk, subway, and traffic, yet wheelchair access is impossible here due to disrepair and inaccessible planning of the subway. People whose mobility does not rely on a wheelchair would be able to traverse this landscape with ease. People using wheelchairs would also find better maintained sidewalks in higher-income areas of the city. This literal roadblock impedes the ability of low-income people with wheelchairs to move about the city for work, social support, and medical care in ways that are unique to them. \n",

    "- **note: this article is written semi-humorously as a critique of the gender binary and uses some outdated language**\n",
    "    - the author is not arguing for a pentinary system, but rather for a more nuanced understanding that biological sex is also a spectrum\n",
    "- western culture is built around the notion that there are exactly two distinct sexes\n",
    "    - this affects everything from language to law to medicine\n",
    "    - this is not representative of the biological reality\n",
    "- intersex is a catchall term for people who do not fit the binary\n",
    "    - there are many different ways this can manifest\n",

    "        - female pseudohermaphrodites - people with ovarian tissue and some degree of masculinization\n",
    "            - the author refers to them as ferms\n",
    "    - The author suggests as a minimum of five biologically distinct sexes at a minimum\n",
    "    - estimates suggest as many as 4% of the population may be intersex\n",
    "        - most of these cases are not visible or are medically treated at birth such that many people may not know they are intersex\n",
    "    - herms may have one or both of their gonads functioning and producing hormones\n",
    "    - merms may have testicular tissue but otherwise develop as female with breasts, clitoris, and vagina\n",
    "    - ferms may have ovarian tissue but otherwise develop as male with beards, deep voices, and adult-size penises\n",

    "    - Plato suggesting a third sex, hermaphrodite, which was lost to time\n",
    "- by the 1960s, the focus had become medical intervention\n",
    "    - on one hand this reduces the potential for harm due to being othered\n",
    "    - on the other, it perpetuates the norm, hence validating the harm to those who are openly gender binary nonconforming\n",

    "- Fausto-Sterling posits that a better world is possible through a de-emphasis of medical intervention in favor of expanding our definitions and understanding of the sexes\n",

    "    - these rates are likely to be higher in some populations and lower in others\n",
    "- many reassigned intersex individuals have reported dissatisfaction with the results of their surgeries\n",
    "    - many have rejected the changes and sought to reverse them\n",
    "        - this can be a difficult and painful process\n",
