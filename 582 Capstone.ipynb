    "Summary of the project they are pitching:\n",
    "- The presenter wants a team to create a more robust live ballot tracking system which starts at the ballot box rather than once it is in the postal service. This would allow for tracking of which ballot envelopes were placed in a box so that the voters could be notified and new ballots could be submitted if the original was lost. Ballots already come with complex barcodes which should allow ballots to be scanned and tracked earlier than they currently are. The box should count ballots, have an alarm/camera system, retain scanned images, and preferably communicate the live data to the county clerk's office and the dashboard which is visible to the voter. \n",
    "Potential problems with undertaking the project:\n",
    "- There would be security procedures which would have to be followed due to the nature of the data involved. Physical hardware will be a component of this project, power demands, power delivery, etc. will all be considerations. The organization is not married to the boxes that they have currently, so the team has the flexibility to design a new box if they wish, but this would require additional work.\n",

    "- project 1:\n",
    "    - This project would be a smart hook for scaffolding systems, identifying worker status and when a worker falls as well as alerting other workers and supervisors. A Mechanical Engineering capstone team is designing the hardware, they require software engineering to handle transmission of data from the sensors, send safety alerts to supervisors and administrators, and secure the data in a storage system for ready access by safety administrators. \n",
    "- project 2:\n",
    "    - This project would be a smart scaffolding deformation tracking system. It would track and transmit deformation data from sensors, translate the data into a model capable of monitoring stability, and secure the data in a storage system for ready access by safety administrators. The hardware for this is not developed by an ME capstone team but the Construction Safety group has hardware either developed or in development. Ideally the product should be plug and play, i.e. it should be adaptable to any scaffolding system.\n",
    "Potential problems with undertaking the projects:\n",
    "    - The team would have to work with the hardware team and fit the software to their hardware. The team for project 1 has been working on hardware since August and this semester they are starting on physical construction. Because these are personnel safety based projects, significant testing will be required to ensure that the software is reliable and accurate. These should also be easy to use and understand by the end user.\n",

    "- Garmin: Garmin is a company which makes a variety of types of products. As a manager or regular employee, understanding the company's stated mission, vision, and goals is important. Garmin employs vertical integration and builds the vast majority of it's products in house. Garmin makes sports and outdoor equipment such as GPS navigation, satelite communications systems, and wearable devices. Kurt works in the aviation domain at Garmin where they provide most types of electronics which are found in cockpits. The marine domain is similarly all encompassing from simple media displays to fish finders and radars. Garmin also produces automotive products which are often not explicitly branded as Garmin and may be found under the car's manufacturer's name. \n",
    "- Background: Kurt was an aerospace engineering major based on his love of airplanes. After deciding that the aerospace industry can be unstable, he pursued a computer science graduate degree at KU. Eventually, he was hired by garmin as a software engineer and later a manager. From 2022 on he has served as a Staff Software Engineer. \n",
    "- Management: Many positions that involve managerial duties may not have \"manager\" in the title. Most organizations have a hierarchy such that your manager will have a manager with a manager. Another key role is that of a mentor. Mentors may or may not be managers. Kurt recommended that people who are interested in management should consider past managers they have had and what they liked or disliked about them. He also suggested instrospection to consider why you would want a management position as well as when and how you foresee that opportunity arising. He suggested that asking managers and non-managers in different organizations about their experiences can be very informative. It is important to consider that becoming a manager of your colleagues changes the dynamic of the relationship and can be difficult. He also suggests asking what happens after you become a manager.\n",
    "- Kurt's management experience: The problems are different, more numerous, and harder. Some of it is technical issues and some of it is personnel management issues. This should be the expected outcome of a management position. The successes should also be different and more rewarding. The successes should be the successes of your team and not just your own. Leading is often hard for engineers but there are many resources available to help. Management courses, books, and mentorship are all options. Kurt specifically called out mentorship and seeking the advice of managers who you respect and those that have different styles than you do. Managing people can be scary and is often uncomfortable. Asking for help is ok and sometimes you can get another or higher manager to act as the \"bad cop\" or otherwise provide support. Ultimately, sometimes going back to non-management positions should be seen as an option; it may be better for you and it allows new blood to step in and fill that role.\n",
