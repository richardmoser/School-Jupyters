- summary of call (from email to Angela)
<h5>
Angela,
I just got off the phone with Wendy and it kindof started with a hard no and ended with a "I'll run it by my supervisor but we don't do PhDs." She said that she doesn't know anyone in a PhD program and that they could do a masters program on the basis that I could be an adjunct professor with a masters. My understanding is that adjuncts are part time or contract workers by their nature, so I didn't quite think that fit the stability portion of the definition of suitable employment. I mentioned that as well as that my strong preference is to work at a national lab and that in the high energy neutrino detection community, everyone is either working in a national lab or a full time professor who is actively engaged in research. The O NET page for physicists shows for new hires, 49% need a doctoral degree, 39% need to do a postdoc, and 8% can get away with  a "Post-masterâ€™s certificate".
  <h5>
I tried to bring up a few of the talking points you mentioned like how I've been on this path for 4 years quite consistently or that I haven't had access to the VRE resources for my undergrad and that submitting for the Chapter 33 reimbursement still takes away those resources when I probably need them most. I also mentioned that I was told by my research advisor (and several grad students at other institutions) that no one applies to a masters program in physics, they apply for a PhD and they may take the masters and walk when they get to that point if that is their plan. I didn't really get a chance to say much more than that though and she didn't seem super interested in hearing it so I doubt much of that will make it to her supervisor. We didn't even talk about how any of this relates to my disabilities where probably the number one thing I am looking for is stability and adjunct sounds like the exact opposite of that is written into the job description. I'm not really sure if there's a way to convey any additional context at this point. She said she would try to schedule an appointment for next week because she is out the next. I am hoping that she has time early in the week because I'm packing and traveling (to present research at a conference) Thursday through Monday.
  <h5>
</h5>
One other note, I called the GI Bill phone line and they confirmed that I am sort of in pergatory with things staying denied until I am determined to be in or out of the VRE program. I figured I'd let you know since everyone seems to be surprised when I tell them I'm not getting paid haha. Hopefully I'm an edge case and this doesn't happen to anyone in the future.
  </h5>

Let me know if you have any advice for communicating my intentions or proceeding otherwise. I really don't want to settle for "you could be an adjunct" and then not be able to access the counseling and support during grad school and then when I look for a job and would therefore benefit from employment assitance. Thanks for all your patience and help in this process!
