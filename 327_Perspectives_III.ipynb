    "### HIV Is Not for Me\n",
    "- HIV/AIDS in WSW communities of sub-Saharan Africa are not well understood \n",
    "- research and discussions of this topic are complicated by social stigmatization of WSW individuals from within their own communities\n",
    "    - WSW is often seen as not at risk for HIV/AIDS and therefore any infection is regarded as a result of promiscuity outside of \"real\" lesbianism\n",
    "    - in reality, WSW individuals are at risk for HIV/AIDS and a lack of awareness increases the risk of infection\n",
    "    - over 50% of participants had not talked to a healthcare workerd about sexual health\n",
    "- increased awareness and education is needed to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS in WSW communities\n",
    "    - social stigmas must be addressed to allow for open discussion and education\n",
    "    - education must be tailored to the specific needs of WSW individuals\n",
    "    - the internet is a valuable resource for providing information and support and some participants had used it to find information\n",
    "- the African Charter on Human and People's Rights on the Rights of Women\n",
    "    - ratified by most African countries\n",
    "        - enforcement varies by country as does equitable access to healthcare\n",
    "    - provides a framework for addressing women's rights and health issues including HIV/AIDS\n",
    "    - does not specifically address sexual orientation\n",
    "        - still, WSW clearly qualify as \"women\" and are therefore protected under the charter as women\n",
    "        - WSW sex may not be considered sex within the legal definition of the charter\n",
    "### From Health Crisis to Rights Advocacy\n",
    "- much has been written about the relationship between HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ activism in the United States\n",
    "- this paper looks into similar movements in China and Singapore\n",
    "    - despite authoritarian governments, HIV/AIDS created an opportunity for LGBTQ activism\n",
    "    - governments were eventually forced to address the epidemic\n",
    "    - some organizations were able to use the epidemic to push for LGBTQ rights while others attempted to distance themselves from it to avoid further stigmatization\n",
    "- in China, funding for HIV/AIDS research and prevention came from both international and domestic sources but was allocated by the government in either case\n",
    "- in Singapore, the government controlled the funding and engagement with activists to limit their ability to challenge the political status quo\n",
    "    - same-sex contact between men is illegal in Singapore\n",
    "    - in the first decade, NGOs were forced to be funded domestically by local private supporters\n",
    "        - Singapore is considered \"developed\" and therefore largely ignored by international funding sources\n",
    "        - the government did not provide significant funding for HIV/AIDS research and prevention\n",
    "    - in the 1990s, the government provided increased funding but used it as a means to control and limit the activities of NGOs\n",
    "        - those who accepted funding were required to follow government guidelines\n",
    "        - they could not advocate for other LGBTQ rights\n",
    "- main strategies employed by groups\n",
    "    - partner with the state, avoid LGBTQ advocacy\n",
    "        - registered\n",
    "        - focused on HIV/AIDS prevention\n",
    "        - distanced themselves from LGBTQ activism\n",
    "    - partner with the state, attempt to advocate for LGBTQ rights where possible\n",
    "        - registered\n",
    "        - focused on HIV/AIDS prevention\n",
    "        - attempted to advocate for LGBTQ rights in non-confrontational ways\n",
    "    - avoid the state, advocate for LGBTQ rights\n",
    "        - unregistered\n",
    "        - focused on adancing LGBTQ rights\n",

    "    - because it was not well documented or at least not well understood before then, D'emilio argues that a mythic history was created in its place\n",
    "    - the mythic history (probably inadvertently) suggests that the oppression of queer people is timeless and unchanging and that queer people have always existed as a distinct group\n",
    "- challenging the myth\n",
    "    - capitalism converted economically independent family units into dependent wage earners and consumers\n",
    "        - this created a new form of family life\n",
    "        - a family was still internally interdependent but not economically independent from the rest of society\n",
    "            - in the 1800s, the wife still cooked bread but she bought the flour and the man worked for the money to buy the flour\n",
    "            - i.e. the family was no longer self-sufficient and the woman was still dependent \n",
    "    - the new economics changed the definition of heterosexual norms\n",
    "        - prior to this change, sex was meant for procreation and birth rates were high\n",
    "            - multiple children were needed to work the farm or business and overcome high infant mortality rates\n",
    "            - the societal definition of morally acceptable sexuality was built around procreation\n",
    "                - i.e. it was not that heterosexuality was celebrated, rather it was that *any* form of sex out of wedlock was condemned\n",
    "        - after the change, birth rates dropped and the purpose of sex changed\n",
    "            - the economic changes allowed queer people to explore their sexualities in more material ways and form communities\n",
    "            - notions of sexual identity began to form\n",
    "                - i.e. homosexuality became a distinct identity rather than a behavior\n",

    "This assignment is designed to make you learn additional aspects of LGBTQ history and to strengthen your critical analysis of how gender and sexuality changes over time, is dependent upon location, and other identities and forces at work at any given moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "First identify a particular person (or place or event) in LBGTQ history. Once you’ve chosen your person (or place/event), explain and analyze how definitions and understandings of sexuality in that particular moment shaped that person (or place/event) Finally reflect upon the differences in historical and geographic contexts between your chosen person (or place/event) and the present day.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment requires you to write a 3 to 4-page paper. You should have a thesis, dedicate roughly 1 page to identifying your chosen person (or place/event), 1.5 – 2 pages analyzing and explaining how definitions and understandings of sexuality in that particular moment shaped your chosen person (or place/event), and 1 page reflecting upon differences between how sexuality was understood during the lifetime of your chosen person (or place/event) and present day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to use google or library database searches to research your person, place, or event.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Identifying and explaining your chosen person/place/event: 15%\n",
    "This is largely a summary of your chosen person/place/event. However, you also need to provide some larger context about the time and place relating to your choice. I know a good bit about LGBTQ history, but I can’t know everything; consider this your one-page opportunity to teach me the important aspects of your chosen person/place/event.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis: 35%\n",
    "How have definitions and understandings of sexuality in that particular moment shaped your chosen person/place/event? Use the themes of the course to help you dig deeply and provide some strong analysis about what forces created this person/place/event.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflection: 25%\n",
    "Reflect on the differences in historical and geographic contexts between your chosen person/place/event and the present day, connecting when possible with the course themes laid out in the class. Where have there been major shifts? What do those changes mean for LGBTQ folks today?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing: 15%\n",
    "Writing should be clear, concise, and constructive. Make an argument! Is there a particular oppression, theme, social force that shapes your person/place/event? If so, that can be a great source of thesis inspiration! (Example: Martin Luther King Jr.’s choice to use peaceful protest stood in stark contrast to the violence most people of color faced in the United States during the 1960s.) Help your thesis along by providing supporting topic sentences for every paragraph afterward. Topic sentences should be the first sentence of every paragraph and should both introduce a new level of your analysis AND also help support your main thesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formatting and Citations: 10%\n",
    "Papers should be written in 12 pt. Times New Roman font unless cleared with the instructor. Page margins should be 1-inch on each side. Include your name and a title for your paper. You do NOT need to include any other headings (instructor name/date/class/etc.) or an abstract/title for your paper, but please follow a standard citation style for your parenthetical/“in-text” citations (e.g., APA, Chicago, MLA). If you need help with formatting your paper and citations, please ask me! I’m happy to help you.\n"

    "- This article follows a similar theme to previous readings around hetero and homonormativity\n",
    "- the NYT has declared this the \"age of the twink\"\n",
    "    - this seems to be true at least for what forms of gender fluidity are being elevated in popular media\n",
    "    - white, straight, cis men with feminine presentation and dress are being celebrated\n",
    "    - at the same time, trans and queer people are being attacked and excluded\n",
    "- allowing some men to be feminine is progress but it is nowhere near enough\n",
    "    - women and nonbinary people of all body types, presentations, and identities must be afforded the same respect and celebration\n",
    "#### Greater transgender visibility hasn't helped nonbinary people – like me\n",
    "- our culture has an ingrained suspicion that gender nonconformity implies intent for harmful deception\n",
    "- while we are seeing greater trans visibility, nonbinary people are still largely ignored and misunderstood and discourse around trans individuals focuses passing and binary presentation\n",
    "    - these forms of representation challenge the idea that gender is innate but not that the binary is the only option\n"

    "- Hijras and Drag Queens reading\n",
    "    - Culture:\n",
    "        - drag is not built into our culture\n",
    "        - Hijras are a part of Indian culture and have been for a long time\n",
    "        - Hijras challenge the gender binary but not the cultural understanding of gender\n",
    "    - Reproduction:\n",
    "        - Hijras are unable to have children and this is seen as a fundamental part of their identity\n",
    "        - drag generally doesn't imply an ability/inability to reproduce\n",
    "            - it is not seen as a responsible or healthy parenting choice\n",
    "    - Identity vs Performance:\n",
    "        - Hijra is a gender identity\n",
    "        - drag is a performance\n",
    "            - i.e. generally one goes home and takes off the makeup and clothing until the next performance\n",
    "- Why Do We Only Love Genderbending When White Twinks Do It?\n",
    "    - we accept genderbending when the people are already very close to ideal citizens\n",
    "        - particularly the people are usually very conventionally attractive\n",
    "        - and almost exclusively men and white\n",
    "    - it is also usually a more explicit performance or publicity stunt and not an identity\n",
    "        - i.e. its something which these men can dabble in or \"play\" with and then leave behind\n",
    "- Greater Transgender Visibility Hasn't Helped Nonbinary People – Like Me\n",
    "    - everything is still about being able to put people into boxes\n",
    "        - e.g. someone who is nonbinary is \"supposed\" to be androgynous\n"

    "#### Sexuality, History, and Britain’s Colonial Legacy\n",
    "- the British Empire exported its ideas about sexuality when it colonized places like Jamaica\n",
    "    - the conditions under which it was considered morally acceptable to engage in sexual activity was predominantly defined and debated by religious officials\n",
    "    - these religious philosophies were enshrined in law in various ways where possible and tended to disproportionately affect the poor and marginalized\n",
    "- these ideas had to be modified to fit the economic and social conditions constructed in the colonies\n",
    "    - in cases of indentured servitude\n",
    "        - authorities prohibited marriage among indentured servants so that a servant husband could not lay claim to his servant wife's labor\n",
    "        - pregnancy would result in a servant owing more time to their master to cover the cost of pregnancy and childcare\n",
    "    - the shift to slavery\n",
    "        - the masters' property rights to a slave extended to their children\n",
    "        - as the slave trade grew, the legal framework shifted from English common law to a more explicitly racist and oppressive system based on animal husbandry and property law\n",
    "        - where colonizers had avoided sexual activity with servants due to the financial burden of children, they now encouraged it with slaves to increase their property holdings\n",
    "        - in 1761 Jamaica passed a law making it illegal for white fathers to bequeath their property to their mixed race children to prevent the dilution of white wealth\n",
    "    - after slavery\n",
    "        - the change in the social and legal frameworks for defining the legitimacy of children continued to be a tool for oppression\n",
    "        - following the abolition of slavery, the rates of children born out of wedlock were used to measure how \"civilized\" the population was\n",
    "            - here again, African \"promiscuity\" was used to other and oppress\n",
    "        - even as people of color began to own property, they too were forced to participate in the same oppressive systems and perpetuate the same oppressive ideas\n",
    "        - sexism played a heavy role as well with the blame for illegitimate children falling heavily on the mother\n",
    "            - sexism, racism, classism all came into play to pit the oppressed against each other and protect those in power\n",
    "                - again we see proximity to the center of the circle of citizenship weaponized to protect abusers and the status quo\n",
    "#### The idea that African homosexuality was a colonial import is a myth\n",
    "- a pervasive myth in Africa is that homosexuality did not exist before colonialism\n",
    "    - American evengelicals have helped to perpetuate this myth and to spread homophobia in Africa\n",
    "- homosexuality has been recorded by Europeans in Africa since at least the 16th century\n",
    "    - early explorers noted a number of different sexual practices and identities across Africa\n",
    "    - rock paintings in Zimbabwe from thousands of years ago depict anal sex between men\n",
    "- Christian and Islamic forces did not bring homosexuality to the African continent, they brough homophobia\n",
    "    - they *did* corrupt and pollute a rich tapestry of cultures and practices\n",
    "        - Not by bringing in homosexuality, but by destroying and oppressing the diverse people and cultures they encountered and enforcing their own narrow minded views\n",

    "    - criticizing the lens of the second reading\n",
    "        - the author is projecting their own modern understanding of homosexuality as an identity onto the past\n",
    "        - the examples cited would not fit this modern definition\n",
    "            - i.e. the people at the times would likely not identify with this modern definition\n",

    "                - this continues to ignore the original boxes\n",
    "                - hence it does not actually give legitimacy to the original identities, it just argues the legitimacy of eurocentric identities\n",
    "        - through this framing, homosexuality (and homophobia) actually was imported through colonialism\n",
    "            - this western understanding of homosexuality and the categorization of acts into boxes was imported\n",
