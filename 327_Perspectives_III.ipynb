    "### HIV Is Not for Me\n",
    "- HIV/AIDS in WSW communities of sub-Saharan Africa are not well understood \n",
    "- research and discussions of this topic are complicated by social stigmatization of WSW individuals from within their own communities\n",
    "    - WSW is often seen as not at risk for HIV/AIDS and therefore any infection is regarded as a result of promiscuity outside of \"real\" lesbianism\n",
    "    - in reality, WSW individuals are at risk for HIV/AIDS and a lack of awareness increases the risk of infection\n",
    "    - over 50% of participants had not talked to a healthcare workerd about sexual health\n",
    "- increased awareness and education is needed to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS in WSW communities\n",
    "    - social stigmas must be addressed to allow for open discussion and education\n",
    "    - education must be tailored to the specific needs of WSW individuals\n",
    "    - the internet is a valuable resource for providing information and support and some participants had used it to find information\n",
    "- the African Charter on Human and People's Rights on the Rights of Women\n",
    "    - ratified by most African countries\n",
    "        - enforcement varies by country as does equitable access to healthcare\n",
    "    - provides a framework for addressing women's rights and health issues including HIV/AIDS\n",
    "    - does not specifically address sexual orientation\n",
    "        - still, WSW clearly qualify as \"women\" and are therefore protected under the charter as women\n",
    "        - WSW sex may not be considered sex within the legal definition of the charter\n",
    "### From Health Crisis to Rights Advocacy\n",
    "- much has been written about the relationship between HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ activism in the United States\n",
    "- this paper looks into similar movements in China and Singapore\n",
    "    - despite authoritarian governments, HIV/AIDS created an opportunity for LGBTQ activism\n",
    "    - governments were eventually forced to address the epidemic\n",
    "    - some organizations were able to use the epidemic to push for LGBTQ rights while others attempted to distance themselves from it to avoid further stigmatization\n",
    "- in China, funding for HIV/AIDS research and prevention came from both international and domestic sources but was allocated by the government in either case\n",
    "- in Singapore, the government controlled the funding and engagement with activists to limit their ability to challenge the political status quo\n",
    "    - same-sex contact between men is illegal in Singapore\n",
    "    - in the first decade, NGOs were forced to be funded domestically by local private supporters\n",
    "        - Singapore is considered \"developed\" and therefore largely ignored by international funding sources\n",
    "        - the government did not provide significant funding for HIV/AIDS research and prevention\n",
    "    - in the 1990s, the government provided increased funding but used it as a means to control and limit the activities of NGOs\n",
    "        - those who accepted funding were required to follow government guidelines\n",
    "        - they could not advocate for other LGBTQ rights\n",
    "- main strategies employed by groups\n",
    "    - partner with the state, avoid LGBTQ advocacy\n",
    "        - registered\n",
    "        - focused on HIV/AIDS prevention\n",
    "        - distanced themselves from LGBTQ activism\n",
    "    - partner with the state, attempt to advocate for LGBTQ rights where possible\n",
    "        - registered\n",
    "        - focused on HIV/AIDS prevention\n",
    "        - attempted to advocate for LGBTQ rights in non-confrontational ways\n",
    "    - avoid the state, advocate for LGBTQ rights\n",
    "        - unregistered\n",
    "        - focused on adancing LGBTQ rights\n",
    "    - avoid the state challenge the state\n",
    "        - unregistered\n",

    "- queer history has often been discussed as if it began in the mid 20th century\n",
    "    - because it was not well documented or at least not well understood before then, D'emilio argues that a mythic history was created in its place\n",
    "    - the mythic history (probably inadvertently) suggests that the oppression of queer people is timeless and unchanging and that queer people have always existed as a distinct group\n",
    "- challenging the myth\n",
    "    - capitalism converted economically independent family units into dependent wage earners and consumers\n",
    "        - this created a new form of family life\n",
    "        - a family was still internally interdependent but not economically independent from the rest of society\n",
    "            - in the 1800s, the wife still cooked bread but she bought the flour and the man worked for the money to buy the flour\n",
    "            - i.e. the family was no longer self-sufficient and the woman was still dependent \n",
    "    - the new economics changed the definition of heterosexual norms\n",
    "        - prior to this change, sex was meant for procreation and birth rates were high\n",
    "            - multiple children were needed to work the farm or business and overcome high infant mortality rates\n",
    "            - the societal definition of morally acceptable sexuality was built around procreation\n",
    "                - i.e. it was not that heterosexuality was celebrated, rather it was that *any* form of sex out of wedlock was condemned\n",
    "        - after the change, birth rates dropped and the purpose of sex changed\n",
    "            - the economic changes allowed queer people to explore their sexualities in more material ways and form communities\n",
    "            - notions of sexual identity began to form\n",
    "                - i.e. homosexuality became a distinct identity rather than a behavior\n",

    "        - capitalism in some ways allowed for the formation of the queer identity\n",
    "        - in some regions it allows queer community to form and grow despite authoritarian regimes\n",

    "        -rainbow capitalism\n",
    "            - rainbow capitalism is more surface level\n",
    "                - e.g. throwing rainbows and pride slogans on products\n",
    "            - e.g. Starbucks goes rainbow for June\n",

    "            - difficult topic for some if not most groups to fully differentiate\n",
    "            - pink capitalism is still exploitative but may be more community oriented and circulate capital within the community, but mostly as a side effect\n",
    "            - pink capitalism is more locally focused while rainbow capitalism is more nationally or globally focused\n",

    "    - still, as cited in the Tatianna \"Villain Cut\", editing has been used as a narrative tool at the expense of some queens and their styles\n",
    "        - in the companion series *Untucked*, transphobic comments are played for laughs at Tatiana's expense\n",
    "            - it is worth noting that Tatiana expresses that she is not transgender, so the comments seem even more out of nowhere\n",
