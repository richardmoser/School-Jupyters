    "# 16Feb25 Readings\n",
    "### HIV Is Not for Me\n",
    "- HIV/AIDS in WSW communities of sub-Saharan Africa are not well understood \n",
    "- research and discussions of this topic are complicated by social stigmatization of WSW individuals from within their own communities\n",
    "    - WSW is often seen as not at risk for HIV/AIDS and therefore any infection is regarded as a result of promiscuity outside of \"real\" lesbianism\n",
    "    - in reality, WSW individuals are at risk for HIV/AIDS and a lack of awareness increases the risk of infection\n",
    "    - over 50% of participants had not talked to a healthcare workerd about sexual health\n",
    "- increased awareness and education is needed to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS in WSW communities\n",
    "    - social stigmas must be addressed to allow for open discussion and education\n",
    "    - education must be tailored to the specific needs of WSW individuals\n",
    "    - the internet is a valuable resource for providing information and support and some participants had used it to find information\n",
    "- the African Charter on Human and People's Rights on the Rights of Women\n",
    "    - ratified by most African countries\n",
    "        - enforcement varies by country as does equitable access to healthcare\n",
    "    - provides a framework for addressing women's rights and health issues including HIV/AIDS\n",
    "    - does not specifically address sexual orientation\n",
    "        - still, WSW clearly qualify as \"women\" and are therefore protected under the charter as women\n",
    "        - WSW sex may not be considered sex within the legal definition of the charter\n",
    "### From Health Crisis to Rights Advocacy\n",
    "- much has been written about the relationship between HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ activism in the United States\n",
    "- this paper looks into similar movements in China and Singapore\n",
    "    - despite authoritarian governments, HIV/AIDS created an opportunity for LGBTQ activism\n",
    "    - governments were eventually forced to address the epidemic\n",
    "    - some organizations were able to use the epidemic to push for LGBTQ rights while others attempted to distance themselves from it to avoid further stigmatization\n",
    "- in China, funding for HIV/AIDS research and prevention came from both international and domestic sources but was allocated by the government in either case\n",
    "- in Singapore, the government controlled the funding and engagement with activists to limit their ability to challenge the political status quo\n",
    "    - same-sex contact between men is illegal in Singapore\n",
    "    - in the first decade, NGOs were forced to be funded domestically by local private supporters\n",
    "        - Singapore is considered \"developed\" and therefore largely ignored by international funding sources\n",
    "        - the government did not provide significant funding for HIV/AIDS research and prevention\n",
    "    - in the 1990s, the government provided increased funding but used it as a means to control and limit the activities of NGOs\n",
    "        - those who accepted funding were required to follow government guidelines\n",
    "        - they could not advocate for other LGBTQ rights\n",
    "- main strategies employed by groups\n",
    "    - partner with the state, avoid LGBTQ advocacy\n",
    "        - registered\n",
    "        - focused on HIV/AIDS prevention\n",
    "        - distanced themselves from LGBTQ activism\n",
    "    - partner with the state, attempt to advocate for LGBTQ rights where possible\n",
    "        - registered\n",
    "        - focused on HIV/AIDS prevention\n",
    "        - attempted to advocate for LGBTQ rights in non-confrontational ways\n",
    "    - avoid the state, advocate for LGBTQ rights\n",
    "        - unregistered\n",
    "        - focused on adancing LGBTQ rights\n",
    "    - avoid the state challenge the state\n",
    "        - unregistered\n",
    "        - campaigned against anti-LGBTQ laws\n",
