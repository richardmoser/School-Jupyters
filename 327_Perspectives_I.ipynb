    "- note: in class I thought that the instructor indicated that this text argued that the term \"cisgender\" reinforced norms and helped to other trans and gender nonconforming people\n",
    "    - I did not get this on first reading and have revisited the article, again finding that it argues the opposite\n",
    "    - I may have misunderstood the instructor but I wanted to be upfront about this discrepancy \n",
    "- my weird metaphor and analysis for understanding the reading (not from the reading)\n",
    "    - yin legitimizes Yang \n",
    "        - we don't have a term for people with red blood or people who breathe air\n",
    "            - as far as I know, people with colors of blood or other prefered respiratory systems don't exist\n",
    "            - more importantly, we don't conceive of their existence nor consider our own existence in these terms\n",
    "                - to be person is to be assumed to have red blood and breathe air, there's no need to specify\n",
    "                - that is the default and we don't even think of it as default because that would imply that there are other options\n",
    "        - creating and using a term for what is considered the default implies the existence of alternatives\n",
    "        - after all, there would be no word for yin if yang were not real and valid in its own right\n",
    "            - possibly a terrible metaphore, but it's the one I've got\n",
    "- from the reading\n",
    "    - \"'Cisgender' suggests a commonality among transgender and non-transgender people...It tells us that we all experience some kind of relationship between our bodies and our selves, whatever that relationship may be.\" \n",
    "        - -- Paula Blank\n",
    "        - important corollaries to this recognition that cis people also have a relationship between their bodies and selves:\n",
    "            - being \"gender conforming\" is it's own condition, not a lack of a condition\n",
    "                - it is thus in need of being accounted for\n",
    "            - **what is \"normal\" is having a relationship to gender, not having a specific relationship to it** \n",
    "                - from this context, gender nonconforming people are not people having an unknowable or alien experience, but people having a different version of a common experience that all people have\n",
    "#### Dismantling Cis Privilege\n",
    "- this piece discusses \"gendering\", the process of evaluating the gender identity of new people we meet\n",
    "    - especially for cis people, this is largely subconscious and automatic\n",
    "        - because cis people are rarely wrong, or at least rarely told, and rarely misgendered so they don't have to think about it\n",
    "    - the \"cissexual assumption\": the assumption that everyone is cisgender until proven otherwise\n",
    "        - i.e. \"my experience must be universal, everyone is like me\"\n",
    "- the author compares the \"birthright\" gender argument to other birthright arguments such as caste systems\n",
    "- trans facsimilation\n",
    "    - if person A didn't know that person B was trans, they wouldn't think anything of it\n",
    "    - if person A finds out, they often begin to think of all the ways that person B is different from their expectation of a \"rea\" member of their gender\n",
    "        - this is often a subconscious process\n",
    "    - everything is just normal differences between people until there's a reason to expect them to be different\n",
    "        - i.e. suddenly you have a conclusion (they are trans) looking for evidence\n",
    "            - prior to being made aware of this \"conclusion\", person A had made their own conclusions about person B based on the same evidence\n",
    "                - why does the new conclusion invalidate the old one?\n",
    "- **most genetic male/female people have never been genetically tested to confirm their genetic sex**\n",

    "- notions of \"biological\" sex are similarly flawed\n",

    "    - if it's about your parts, what about people who are sterile? Are post-menopausal women suddenly without gender?\n",
    "- third gendering\n",
    "    - use of language like FTM, MTF, trans man, etc can be othering\n",

    "- gendering and passing\n",

    "        - the colonists are not interested in the land itself, only the resources\n",
    "    - **settler colonialism**: focuses on land and the elimination of indigenous peoples to make way for settlers\n",
    "        - the colonists are interested in the land itself\n",
    "    - plantation colonialism: a mix of exploitation and settler colonialism, where the colonists are primarily interested in the land and the resources it can produce\n",
    "- indigenous peoples are erased via genocide, assimilation, or interbreeding\n",
    "- a settler is anyone who is not indigenous to the land in a settler colonial context\n",
    "    - e.g. any non-indigenous person in the US\n",
    "    - intersects with other identities such as race, class, etc.\n",
    "        - not all settlers are equal or chose to be settlers\n",
    "- primitive accumulation: the process of acquiring land and resources from a group of people who are not capitalists.\n",
    "    - i.e. stealing land to create a landless working class\n",
    "    - without land to farm or resources to sell, people are forced to work for wages to survive\n",
    "    - \"entry point into capitalism\"\n",
    "- racial formation: the process of creating racial categories and attributing characteristics to them in order to justify the exploitation of certain groups\n",
    "    - used to maximize exploitation and minimize benefits to the exploited groups\n",
    "        - you must be a minimum percent genetically indigenous to be be deemed a tribal member\n",
    "        - a maximum of \"one drop\" (any) of black blood made you black per the \"one drop rule\" \n",
    "    - \"whiteness\" must then be defined in opposition to these racial categories\n",
    "        - whiteness is defined as the absence of the characteristics attributed to the exploited groups\n",

    "#### Decolonizing Feminism: Challenging Connections between Settler Colonialism and Heteropatriarchy (2013)\n",
    "- indigenous communities are often less interested in equality and civil rights from the colonial state and more interested in independence and sovereignty from the colonial state\n",
    "    - the colonial state is not a neutral arbiter of social justice, but a colonizer itself\n",
    "- First Challenge: problematize and theorize the intersections of settler colonialism, heteropatriarchy, and heteropaternalism - Second Challenge: refuse the erasure of Indigenous women within gender and women’s studies and reconsider the implications of the end game of (only) inclusion\n",
    "- Third Challenge: actively seek alliances in which differences are respected and issues of land and tribal belonging are not erased in order to create solidarity, but rather, relationships to settler colonialism are acknowledged as issues that are critical to social justice and political work that must be addressed\n",
    "- Fourth Challenge: to recognize the persistence of Indigenous concepts and epistemologies, or ways of knowing.\n",
    "    - recognizing the persistence of Indigenous concepts and epistemologies does not mean blindly copying or performing them oneself, nor does such recognition require excavating “authentic” Indigenous traditions out of a distant past; instead, feminists must recognize Indigenous peoples as the authors of important theories about the world we all live in\n",
    "    - land is not just property, it is a relationship and a source of knowledge\n",
    "    - sovereignty is not only derived by the colonial state; tribal lands, councils, and other institutions are benefits granted by and powers derived from the dominant settler state and thus are not truly sovereign. They come with problematic strings attached.\n",
    "- Fifth Challenge: to question how the discursive and material practices of gender and women’s studies and the academy writ large may participate in the dispossession of Indigenous peoples’ lands, livelihoods, and futures, and to then divest from these practices"
