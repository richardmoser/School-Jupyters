    "Summary:\n",
    "The panelists discussed their current positions as well as the paths which led them there. They also covered advice to graduating students such as how to adjust to being a junior developer, asking questions, and acknowledging imposter syndrome. Alek discussed the work life balance and their experience with good and bad workplace climates around demands and expectations. They cited Programming Paradigms as a class that was particularly helpful in their career, particularly in teaching them object oriented and declarative coding. Operating Systems and Compilers were cited as particularly helpful in learning C and C++ which they utilize in their industry positions. Julia called out a lack of gender representation in the field. Alek discussed his career path in greater detail through several companies, startups, and workplace cultures, as well as a wide array of projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "What did you learn from the event?\n",
    "I learned that there can be many paths to success in the field of computer science. I also found Julia's comments about the benefits and disadvantages of being the sole person who understands and maintains a particular system to be particularly interesting and relevant to my own experience. Alek's commentary on finding your people and maintaining social connections in a new city was also something that I will keep in mind as I move forward in my career.\n",
    "\n",
    "What will you do different because of this event?\n",
    "I think my primary takeaway was that the work-life balance is something that I will need to take a very active role in maintaining. I feel a lot more confident as someone who is already on a nontraditional path; it certainly sounded like Alek in particular but even Julia and Clay also had fairly nonlinear paths to success. The panelists' discussion of the validity and importance of salary negotiation at the entry level was definitely something that I found valuable and  will pursue in my own career. \n",
