    "1. Describe the roles of a hypothetical 5-member 581 team\n",
    "    - As listed below, I think this course lends itself well to a mostly democratic team organization. The project sounds small enough that a 5 person team should be able to make decisions together without too much difficulty. Each person could take on a specialization such as menu and UI elements, art generation, and game mechanics, but significant overlap in skills and labor would be expected.\n",
    "2. Why do you think that team organization would be effective for 581?\n",
    "    - I think a democratic team makes the most sense, at least for my team members or a similar team. We are at similar skill levels but have different areas of expertise. Self organization of tasks should work well for us as people can take on what they are best at or what they are most interested in.\n",
    "3. Which of the following team organizations would you like for your first job and why?\n",
    "    â€“ Team Manager & Team Leader. I think that based off of past (negative) work experience, the more clearly defined separation of technical management from interpersonal/nontechnical management would be a nice change of pace. This would still allow for a clear chain of command and a clear division of labor if implemented correctly. \n"
